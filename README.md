# Learning Terraform
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Learning Terraform`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The code is built sequentally so each branch contains the completed code for that particular video and the starting code can be found in the previous video's branch.

The `main` branch contains the starting code for the course and the `final` branch contains the completed code.
